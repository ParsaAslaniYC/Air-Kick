# Air-Kick
A simple python script that can be use to deauthenticate all clients from a wifi network without even connecting to the wifi network.
# Working
This script automates all the manual tasks requried for performing wifi deauth attack. It takes all required data from the user and automatically puts it in the airmon-ng and aireplay-ng commands.
# Requirements 
You will need a wifi adapter which supports monitor mode. Also this script was written for <b>kali linux</b> only. If you want to run this script on any other os, you'll have to manually install all the required tools.
